# Quiz-Game
[Deployed page](https://waltoids.github.io/Quiz-Game/)

The game is fairly simple.
Hit start to start the quiz game.
You will be given a multiple choice quiz with a 75 second timer.
Once you answer a question you will be given the next question.
If you answer incorrectly, 20 seconds will be removed from the time.
At the end of the quiz your score is calculated based on the time remaining.
You can then put in your initals and the quiz will save them along with your score.
You can then go back and start again using the return button or you can clear the highscore list with the clear button.

# Purpose
